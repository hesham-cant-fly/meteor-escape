Here I'll link to some useful resources
- [[https://www.youtube.com/@codingmath][Coding Math Channel]]: I've watched his video a while ago and it's pretty interesting to watch, his way of explaining math/physics topics is just perfect. For some reason he just despaired and stopped posting videos for some reason. I don't know who he is but I wish that he's just doing alright.
- [[https://www.sevenson.com.au/programming/sat/][SAT]] Although in the source code i didn't implement a SAT collision detection algorithm, but i actually did implement it before i decided to push this project to github.
